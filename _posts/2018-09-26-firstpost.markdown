Hi!

I've always wanted to update my github, write about stuff I am learning everyday, just never got around to it. So here goes.<br><br>
Havent decided any structure for my posts, I'm sorry if they seem a little chaotic. We'll figure it out over time. If nothing else, it'll atleast help me revise and record everything.<br>
<br>
I'm currently pursuing my MS in Computer Science from ASU.<br>
My major areas of interest are Computer Vision, NLP and Deep Learning, expect to see content related to those or heading in that direction.

Cheers!
